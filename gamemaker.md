# Old Game Maker Games

I made my very first games in a piece of software called Game Maker between 2012 and 2015. These games are not very good, some are even unfinished.

I came across these games while browsing through all the things I have ever uploaded to Airload, my go-to file sharing site. The games were posted to [game-maker.nl](http://www.Game-maker.nl/), a dutch site about Game Maker.

## The DDDD: Donald's Adventure (2012, Unfinished)

This was my very first attempt at making a game. I didn't get far; there's only one level. You play as Donald Duck and the goal is to leave the room. You have a healthbar on top which drains if you touch someone else.

**Controls:** Arrow Keys to move

## Shoot Them All! (2012-2015, Unfinished)

Ah yes, my long term project. There is some proof on the forums that I was still working on this in 2015, but the latest downloadable version I could recover was from 2014. This game is a very basic top down shooter.

In 2014 I migrated the save data to Game Maker Server, which is a third party extention that adds multiplayer to Game Maker. Problem is, the version I used in 2014 isn't supported anymore in 2020 (the time I am writing this). Luckily, I had also uploaded the source files back then so I was able modify the game into working again.

**Controls:**

- WASD to move
- Left Mouse Button to shoot
- Mouse Wheel to scroll through bullets

## Mr. Bobble: Let's eat the level (2012-2013, Finished!)

![](http://g2f.nl/0tl0q5m)

The very first game I every finished! You play as Mr. Bobble, who wants to reach the flag. However, you're also hungry, so you must eat parts of the level to stay alive.

This game even includes a full level editor! You can probably make better levels than the seven that already exist.

**Controls in-game:**
 - WASD to move
 - Left Mouse Button to eat nearby pink blocks
 - Spacebar to spit
 - Escape to return to the menu
 
**Controls in the level editor:**
 - Left and right arrow keys to switch between Placing and Difficulty Select
 - Top and bottom arrow keys to change the current block or difficulty
 - Left Mouse Button to place
 - Right Mouse Button to remove
 - T to test
 - Q to stop testing
 - S to save
 - L to load

## Time Machine (2013-2014, Unfinished)

![](http://g2f.nl/0b5cr22)
 
This is basically a copy of the flash game [Chronotron](https://www.kongregate.com/games/scarybug/chronotron). You have a time machine which you can use to team up with your past selves in order to get the chip in each level.

This is my first game to include sound, a cutscene and configurable controls! Speaking of which...

**Controls:**
- WASD to move
- Shift to enter the time machine
